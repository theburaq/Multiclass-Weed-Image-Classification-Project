# üå± Multiclass Weed Image Classification Using Deep Learning üåæ
This is an AgriAI HIVE project done during my Internship with LiveAI.

## üåü Project Overview
Weed infestation is a critical challenge in sustainable agriculture, impacting crop yields and increasing reliance on herbicides. This project addresses the need for precise weed identification by leveraging deep learning to classify 8 distinct weed categories using over 17,000 RGB images. The project also features a user-friendly web application interface developed using Streamlit for real-time weed classification.

## üîç Objective
The goal is to develop a model that can help farmers automate the identification of various weed species, reducing manual effort and improving crop yield. We experimented on weed datasets by DeepWeed using two CNN architectures namely ResNet-50 and Inception-v3, and compare the results.

## üí° Features
* **Multiclass Classification:** Classifies 8 distinct weed categories.
* **Data Augmentation:** Applied augmentation techniques to address data imbalance.
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilized pretrained ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 architectures for experimentation.
* **Custom Model:** Built a CNN (ResNet-50) model from scratch for performance benchmarking.
* **Streamlit Integration:** Real-time predictions through a web-based application.

 ## üìÇ Dataset
* **Source:** RGB images of various plant weeds.
* **Format**: The data is stored in `.csv` format. 
* **Size:** Over 17,000 images.
* **Categories:** 8 distinct weed types.
* You can download the dataset:
    * From TesnsorFlow dataset hub: [https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/deep_weeds](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/deep_weeds), OR
